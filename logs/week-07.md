### Focus

This week focused on building face embeddings using Siamese networks and developing a basic Gradio interface for face verification.

---

## Goals for the Week

* Build and train a Siamese Network on facial data
* Visualize embeddings with PCA/t-SNE plots
* Create Gradio demo for pairwise verification
* Understand loss functions: Triplet vs. Contrastive

---

## Tasks Completed

| Task                                      | Status      | Notes                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Built a Siamese model with twin encoders  | âœ… Completed | Shared weights, used Euclidean distance layer        |
| Trained on pairs with contrastive loss    | âœ… Completed | Also tested triplet loss for comparison              |
| Created basic Gradio app for verification | âœ… Completed | Users can upload two photos and see similarity score |
| Embedded data visualized with PCA & t-SNE | âœ… Completed | Separated clusters for same vs. different identities |

## Problems Faced & Solutions

| Problem                                      | Solution                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Slow training on CPU                         | Switched to Google Colab with GPU runtime            |
| High false positives with low-res inputs     | Set minimum resolution requirements in preprocessing |
| Confusion in contrastive vs triplet training | Trained both to compare their margin effectiveness   |
