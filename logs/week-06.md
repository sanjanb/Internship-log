### Focus

This week was focused on understanding high-impact research papers related to facial recognition and multimodal learning. The insights helped us benchmark approaches and select the right direction for extending our current work ‚Äî all within NDA constraints.

---

## Goals for the Week

* Analyze top papers including DeepFace, CelebA, and MS-Celeb-1M
* Identify architectural and training strategies from published work
* Extract reusable code components or libraries
* Build internal notes for adaptation (non-disclosable externally)

## Tasks Completed

| Task                                                 | Status      | Notes                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Reviewed DeepFace CVPR 2014 Paper                    | ‚úÖ Completed | Extracted high-level architecture and pre-processing   |
| Summarized CelebA Dataset Usage & Purpose            | ‚úÖ Completed | Documented data splits and key attributes              |
| Reviewed MS-Celeb-1M Large-Scale Benchmark           | ‚úÖ Completed | Noted benchmark criteria, dataset challenges           |
| Matched CLIP/VLM output to internal project pipeline | ‚úÖ Completed | Used vision encoder outputs in internal test framework |
| Maintained private internal analysis notes (NDA)     | ‚úÖ Completed | For mentor review, not open-sourced                    |

## Key Learnings

{: .callout-success }

* Paper reading deepens understanding of **real-world implementations**
* Face verification success hinges on **alignment + representation**
* Vision-language models (like CLIP) can be modularized efficiently
* Datasets vary in complexity, annotation quality, and usage rights

## Problems Faced & Solutions

| Problem                           | Solution                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| No direct code in papers          | Used matching PyPI libraries (e.g., DeepFace)  |
| Understanding legacy methods      | Referred to official benchmark sites and repos |
| Need to protect internal insights | Maintained internal-only notebooks (under NDA) |

## Goals for Next Week

* Integrate internal code with vision encoder embeddings
* Begin training internal pipeline with updated feature vectors
* Prepare learnings page with clean summaries (non-sensitive)
