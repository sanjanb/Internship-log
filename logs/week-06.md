### Focus

This week concentrated on preparing datasets for facial analysis, creating scripts for automated cropping and landmarking, and exploring CLI-based efficiency tools.

---

## Goals for the Week

* Curate and preprocess facial datasets for recognition tasks
* Extract landmarks and keypoints from image samples
* Develop reusable CLI scripts for dataset pipeline tasks
* Speed up experimentation through image filters and masks

---

## Tasks Completed

| Task                                               | Status      | Notes                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Downloaded and cleaned dataset from CelebA         | âœ… Completed | Filtered high-quality aligned faces              |
| Implemented facial landmark extraction             | âœ… Completed | Used Dlib + OpenCV for 68-point facial landmarks |
| Built CLI cropping & resize tool                   | âœ… Completed | Takes image folder and bounding boxes as input   |
| Designed basic image filter pipelines (blur, mask) | âœ… Completed | Included grayscale, Gaussian blur, binary mask   |

## Key Learnings

{: .callout-success }

* Learned how to automate dataset preprocessing steps
* Improved proficiency with OpenCV, Dlib, and face alignment
* Created CLI tools that reduce redundant image processing effort
* Observed that clean and aligned datasets boost model stability

## Problems Faced & Solutions

| Problem                             | Solution                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bounding box errors during cropping | Adjusted coordinates with margins to avoid cutting faces |
| Low confidence landmark detection   | Applied CLAHE (contrast enhancement) before detection    |
| CLI errors on large batches         | Used multiprocessing and file-safe loops                 |
