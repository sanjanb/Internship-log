# CelebA: Large-Scale Face Attribute Dataset & Its High‚ÄëQuality Variants

**Dataset**: [CelebA: Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes in the Wild]  
**Source**: MMLab CUHK & PyTorch Vision  
**Released**: 2015 for CelebA; CelebA‚ÄëHQ & downstream variants emerged later

---

## Overview

- **CelebA** offers ~200K celebrity face images annotated with **40+ binary attributes** and identities‚Äîideal for attribute recognition and generative modeling.
- **CelebA-HQ** refines this into a **high-quality 30K images** at 1024√ó1024 resolution with precise face crops (via Progressive GANs).
- **CelebAMask-HQ** adds rich **semantic segmentation masks** for detailed facial components (19 classes) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## üõ† Working Code that Can be Used

### 1. PyTorch Loader
```python
from torchvision.datasets import CelebA
dataset = CelebA(root="data/", split="train", target_type="attr", download=True)
````

Built-in support in `torchvision` for CelebA ‚Äî no third-party installs needed ([GitHub][1]).

### 2. Downloader & HQ Converter

The **make-CelebA-HQ** script can reconstruct CelebA-HQ from the original dataset:

* Downloads CelebA & CelebA‚ÄëHQ archives
* Runs `make_HQ_images.py` to produce high‚Äëres `.npy` image files at 1024√ó1024 ([GitHub][2]).

---

## Other Community Tools

* **PyTorch loader with identities**: includes MS-CelebA identity labels (`identity_CelebA.txt`) and a notebook for testing ([GitHub][3]).

---

## Practical Notes

* Official MMLab page provides dataset info but no full code ([mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk][4]).
* Third-party scripts exist but may require manual data placement and external downloads.
* Community tools are more reliable and tested.

---

## Reflections

> *‚ÄúCelebA is foundational ‚Äî but preparing high-quality versions (HQ, mask, identity) makes it usable for advanced generation and evaluation tasks.‚Äù*

* Using high-resolution data with segmentation enables precise inpainting and control networks.
* Attribute-rich annotations allow for strong evaluation on vision and face tasks.
* The PyTorch loader is simple and seamless for everyday use.

### Summary of Findings

- **Official dataset** provides only data and metadata‚Äîno code samples.
- **Working code exists** in community tools:
  - PyTorch `CelebA` loader (built-in)
  - `make-CelebA-HQ` script for preparing upscale dataset
  - Notebooks/helpers for identity attribute loading
- **No fully official code** for parsing or segmentation‚Äîcommunity alternatives recommended.
